## 🚀 Project Overview

**FlightProject** is a modern, full-stack application for safe and effective flight management, specially designed to address travel needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. This platform combines real-time flight operations and health advisories to deliver a reliable solution for travelers and organizations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Flight Management:** Real-time search, booking system, and user authentication.
- **COVID-19 Intelligence:** Live pandemic stats, travel advisories, and safety protocols.
- **User Profiles:** Secure accounts, personalized travel logs, and recommendations.
- **Advanced Data Processing:** Efficient use of JSON for flights, regulations, and users.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Modern UI/UX for desktops and mobile devices.
- **Security:** Strong data privacy and authorization flows.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express ([backend code](./travel-during-covid-backend))
- **Frontend:** React.js ([frontend code](./travel-during-covid-frontend))
- **Data Sources:**
    - [`flights.json`](./flights.json) – Core flight/travel database
    - [`covid.json`](./covid.json) – COVID-19 live data and rules
    - [`users.json`](./users.json) – User data and authentication
- **Demo:** [`welcome to our Website.mp4`](./welcome%20to%20our%20Website.mp4)
